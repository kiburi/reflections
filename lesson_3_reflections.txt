When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When contributing to open source projects
2. To access my work from another computer/ device

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to date with 
your remote repository?
To make sure the changes pulled are complete and ready to be pulled from remote
