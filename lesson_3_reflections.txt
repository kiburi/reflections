When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When contributing to open source projects
2. To access my work from another computer/ device

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to date with 
your remote repository?
To make sure the changes pulled are complete and ready to be pulled from remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: makes a copy of someone's repository directly on GitHub servers. Works only on GitHub environment.
Clones: Allows you to make a copy of a repository on your local machine to another location on your local machine or
from GitHub (remote) to your local machine.
Branches: Copies commits from a working branch or master branch to a new branch so that a user can make changes confidently without affecting 
the master branch. User can then merge the new branch to the master to incorporate the changes.
