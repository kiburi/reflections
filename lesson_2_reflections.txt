What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git repository is created in order to start tracking files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area that allows you to add inter-related files and commit them using a single commit to git repository. Helps keep commits small with one commit per
logical change.
Working directory is a repository that is created using git init.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Once you make changes to your files, you add them to the staging area so that you can commit similar files using a single commit rather
than separate commits which reduces the number of commits per changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
You can create a branch when making changes which you're not ready to add to the master. This helps keep the master clean.
In an environment where more than one user is working on a project. Users can create branches and merge them later when done.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams help undertand the commits done performed on each branch and also check relationship between commits and branches.
Branches help check if there are any unreachable commits.
