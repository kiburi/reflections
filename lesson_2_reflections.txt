What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A git repository is created in order to start tracking files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area that allows you to add inter-related files and commit them using a single commit to git repository. Helps keep commits small with one commit per
logical change.
Working directory is a repository that is created using git init.
